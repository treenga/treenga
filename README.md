# Treenga — Simple and fast issue tracking system

Treenga is  **simple**. Team functions as the main umbrella under which all issues sit. It shares everything with all its members. Issues are grouped with hierarchical tags which allow you to create a structure that perfectly replicates your thinking on a project.  

Treenga promotes working on a  **single task at a time**  and allows you to share detailed information with your teams — write the full story of what you need and get the job done.  

Treenga is  **versatile**. You may use only a couple of tags for one project, and a sophisticated structure with many tags for another. Everything is easily filterable, so you will always be on track.

Treenga is made by using Laravel and Vue.js.

After installation go to [your_server_url]/admin, login using admin/admin name/password and change password. Then you can add users.
